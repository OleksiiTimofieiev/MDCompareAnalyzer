- show FIDs with formatting, spacing to the separate file if they are present
- workaround for bad excel from RECON [resave the workbook with the new name, copy each sheet ot other]
- think about concurrency => array of different containers for parsing
- no spaces in the name of file -> if exception during open file by openpxl
- autoformat the width of the column
- license + gitignore
- deployment strategy
