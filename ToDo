+ menu func
+ read json in constructor(during start)
+ file for analysis in command line
+ usage line
+ FIDs not to be analyzed
+ show RICs and mismatches
+ formatting acceptance. if float === doubles in python are equal but string are different
+ quantity of diffs
+ spaces in the end acceptance == if string from the start is found and remaing length is only spaces
+ set as fixed -> delete from dictionary

- write all diffs to plain text file -> FID == filename, CID folder pass to the command line arguments:
1. create folder
2. create files
3. write to files: if already. do not write

- no spaces in the name of file, if exception during open file by openpxl ->
- main in options selection exception
- по ФИДам в листы экселя, консоль аутпут как опция
